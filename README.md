### Project Title
Bike Share Data

### Description
Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have rapidly expanded in number and popularity across cities worldwide. These systems allow users to rent bikes on a short-term basis for a fee, making it convenient to pick up a bike at one location and return it at another. Alternatively, users can choose to return the bike to the same station if they simply wish to enjoy a ride. In any case, each bike can accommodate several users throughout the day.
With advancements in information technology, accessing and returning bikes has become more user-friendly, as riders can easily unlock or dock their bikes at stations within the system. Additionally, these technologies generate valuable data that offer insights into how bike-sharing systems are utilized.
In this project, you will analyze data provided by Motivate (opens in a new tab), a bike-sharing service operating in several major U.S. cities, to identify usage trends. You will compare the usage patterns across three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.
